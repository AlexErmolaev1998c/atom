Syncinc a fork

Step 1 – Add Upstream Repository
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Firestorm01X2/atom

Step 2 – Fetch Upstream Branches
git fetch upstream
Changes from the upstream (forked repository) are loaded.

Step 3 - Check out your fork's local master branch.
git checkout master

Step 4 - Merge the changes from upstream/master into your local master branch. This brings your fork's master branch into sync with the upstream repository, without losing your local changes.
git merge upstream/master
